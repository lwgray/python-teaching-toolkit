# Understanding Python Delimiters: A 5-Minute Mini-Lecture

## Introduction (30 seconds)
Hey programmers! Today we're going to decode one of Python's most important concepts: delimiters. You see these symbols everywhere in code - (), [], and {} - but when do you use which one? By the end of this lecture, you'll have a foolproof way to remember their specific purposes and uses!

## The Three Types of Delimiters (1 minute)

### Parentheses ( )
Think of these as the "action" delimiters. They're used when Python needs to DO something. Just like when you call someone to take action, parentheses are used to call functions into action, group mathematical operations, and create tuples.

### Square Brackets [ ]
These are your "access" delimiters. Imagine them as an address or index card in a library. When you need to find, access, or modify specific elements in a sequence or mapping type, square brackets are your navigation tool.

### Curly Braces { }
These are your "collection" delimiters. They define and contain related items together, creating structured data types like dictionaries and sets, or formatting strings.

## The Magic Mnemonic (1 minute)
Here's an easy way to remember when to use each delimiter. Think of this sentence:

"**P**lease **C**all **M**e **T**oday, **L**et's **I**nspect **S**ome **D**ata, **D**on't **S**end **F**lowers"

Each part of this sentence maps to a different delimiter type and its uses:

### First Part - Parentheses ( )
"Please Call Me Today"
- **P**lease → Parameters: `print("hello")`
- **C**all → Function calls: `len(list)`
- **M**e → Math operations: `(2 + 3)`
- **T**oday → Tuples: `(x, y)`

### Second Part - Square Brackets [ ]
"Let's Inspect Some Data"
- **L**et's → List creation: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **I**nspect → Index access: `list[0]`
- **S**ome → Slicing: `list[1:3]`
- **D**ata → Dictionary access: `dict['key']`

### Third Part - Curly Braces { }
"Don't Send Flowers"
- **D**on't → Dictionary creation: `{'key': 'value'}`
- **S**end → Set creation: `{1, 2, 3}`
- **F**lowers → Format strings: `f"{variable}"`

## Real-World Examples (1.5 minutes)

Let's see these delimiters in action:

```python
# Parentheses ( ) - "Please Call Me Today"
print("Hello, World!")          # Please - Parameters
len(my_list)                    # Call - Function calls
result = (10 + 5) * 2          # Me - Math
coordinates = (x, y)            # Today - Tuples

# Square Brackets [ ] - "Let's Inspect Some Data"
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]    # Let's - List creation
first_fruit = fruits[0]         # Inspect - Index access
some_fruits = fruits[1:3]       # Some - Slicing
user_data["name"]               # Data - Dictionary access

# Curly Braces { } - "Don't Send Flowers"
person = {"name": "Alice"}      # Don't - Dictionary creation
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}      # Send - Set creation
message = f"{person['name']}"   # Flowers - Format strings
```

## Quick Check (1 minute)
Which delimiter would you use to:
1. Group a mathematical expression?
2. Access a specific index in a list?
3. Define a new dictionary?

The answers should jump out at you using our mnemonic!

## Practice Exercise

Now let's put this into practice! Add the correct delimiters to make this code work:

```python
# 1. Function Calls and Parameters
print "Hello"                        # Fix function call
calculate_sum 5, 10                  # Fix function call with multiple parameters
len "Python"                         # Fix built-in function call

# 2. List and Dictionary Access
shopping_list = "apples", "bananas"  # Create a list
first_item = shopping_list 0         # Access first item
fruits = "apple": "red"              # Create a dictionary
fruit_color = fruits "apple"         # Access dictionary value

# 3. Collections
unique_numbers =  1, 2, 2, 3         # Create a set (notice duplicates)
point =  x, y                        # Create a tuple
grades = "math": 95                  # Create a dictionary

# 4. Combined Usage
def calculate_average scores :        # Fix function definition
    total = sum scores               # Fix function call
    return total / len scores        # Fix function call

student_data = 
    "name": "Alice",
    "grades":  90, 95, 88
```
